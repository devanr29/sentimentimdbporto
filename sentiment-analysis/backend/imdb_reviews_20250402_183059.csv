review
"I was very excited to see this movie as I am a fan of Nicole Kidman and Garcia and thought the premise sounded very interesting.The first and second act is rather slow to build up for a rather strange and bizarre third act that unfortunately fails to deliver on its shock twist.The sad part is this film easily could've been a classic on the level of a Cohen Brothers or David Lynch, but instead it ends with some silly premises that are so far-fetched and a bloody ending that has so many plot holes, you scratch your head almost laughing.Kudos to Nicole Kidman for taking a chance on this film as always she's trying something different and unique and carries the film with Garcia whose role is rather 2 dimensional but this film had no chance even with a great Director
as this horrible script ends up being more like a b movie.5 stars for actors/ director."
"Rating - 5.6:
Overall, a lackluster mystery thriller that Nicole Kidman cannot save because the movie does a bad job trying to subvert your expectations because it tries to lead you down a bad path when searching for the mystery, but the foreshadowing in the beginning and promotional material for this movie already give the conflict away; the movie genuinely feels like 20-30 minutes worth of scenes were cut because there was a lack of context throughout and the movie just feels unfinished towards the end.Direction - Pretty Bad:
The direction on a macroscale is pretty good, as it creates this mystery set in a society stuck in the past, like Holland, Michigan; the direction on a microscale is pretty good, mainly because the main cast is filled with experienced actors, especially Nicole Kidman; the storytelling holds the movie back because it intentionally leads you down the wrong path in the mystery they are trying to solve, and once the actual conflict is revealed, it does not provide any context or explanation for why it happens; they artificially create tension to make this movie a thriller, but not in a good way because it feels obviously forcedStory - Bad to Pretty Bad:
The concept as a whole is pretty good as it presents a conflict across a perfect, stuck-in-time utopia like Holland, Michigan; but that conflict is pretty poor as it intentionally leads the audience down the wrong path to subvert its expectations; the plot structure is a big issue for this movie because the movie basically leads you down an adventure to figure out a mystery, but then when you find out what the actual mystery is, it basically just ends the movie without giving any context or closure; it genuinely feels like 20-30 minutes of this movie was cut because the movie feels unfinished, evidenced by Rachel Sennott's one scene and the ending; the character writing is what you would expect for a movie like this because it follows your vanilla housewife in a traditional family investigating her mysterious husbandScreenplay - Bad to Pretty Bad:
The dialogue is decent and gives the actors something to work with; the humor is decent and helps lighten the mood; the symbolism is not really that good because the movie never really builds on anything or shares why certain plot elements are important; the foreshadowing is a big problem for this movie because the movie foreshadows what the actual conflict for this movie is overtly and very early in the movie, but then the movie foreshadows and goes down a different path throughout the movie; however, because you remember what the foreshadowing was early in the movie, plus the promotional material makes the conflict pretty obvious, it is not shocking at all when the real conflict is revealed, so you just feel like you wasted 40 minutes to get to this pointActing - Pretty Good:
Nicole Kidman - Good (Nicole Kidman can never give a bad performance; it shows here because she really embodies the character and makes the most of what she is given; she has good chemistry with Macfayden and Bernal), Matthew Macfadyen - Pretty Good (Basically plays Tom Wambsgans, but more mysteriously; he has good chemistry with Kidman), Gael García Bernal - Pretty Good (He has pretty good charisma and has good chemistry with Nicole Kidman), Rest of the cast - Decent (A bunch of minor supporting characters do a decent job supporting the main cast)Score - Pretty Good:

Where - Amazon Prime
With Who - MyselfFirst Thoughts -
I'll be honest, I've gone back and forth on whether or not to review this movie. This is because I actually worked on it as a Production Assistant for 17 days of filming. Right off the bat, I want to make it clear that my rating and issues with the overall movie has nothing to do with the amount of effort the entire cast and crew put into it. We worked our tails off to make this film happen, and I'm just happy that it's finally out.That being said, frankly, this isn't a good movie at all. Even during production it was hard to nail down exactly what the story was and what even the point of it was. Now having seen the finished product, it's clear that the higher ups weren't sure either. This film didn't know what it wanted to be, bouncing between the psychological thriller, drama, erotic thriller like a pinball. The actors, all of whom are talented, did the best they could with what they were given. It's clear though that the script needed a few more passes before being pushed into production. A lot of it came across as over explaining and stunted, it didn't really flow naturally.The cinematography was solid, Pawel Pogorzelski showcasing his talented eye as always. But the editing felt very off with abrasive cuts and odd choices of shots used that felt as though they were trying too hard to be unique.Another thing story-wise that frustrated me were choices made by the characters, particularly those made by Nancy Vandergroot. The decisions she makes as the main protagonist are not warranted or justified at all. Sure they pay off in the very end, but they make zero sense when she makes the actual choice. This leaves her feeling erratic and paranoid, making it really difficult to root for her character.Overall, while I'm proud of the work the entire crew and I did here, that hard work simply didn't come across in the final product.Full Review to follow."
"Watched this despite Nicole Kidman's notoriously breathy and childish voice and bad acting and was as expected, extremely disappointed. Terrible storyline. Other than mentioning Frankenmuth and having tulips in the trailer, there are no redeeming qualities.Terrible in every way imaginable. Don't waste your time on this. Watch Ludwig it's a new detective/mystery series and is very good. I need 200 more characters just to post this, which is way to much time to waste on this abomination. Hollywood just keeps putting out garbage. I can't believe this is rated at a five right now. I was hoping to be the first to review it!"
"Holland, is the definition of a surreal, psychedelic ride through mystery and bizarreness. Which I was expecting something just normal. I didn't watch the trailers or anything for this, so I had no idea what I was in for.It's definitely not one of Nicole Kidmans best, but she does carry it so well for you to stay invested, along with all the other cast as well. The acting is great. The movie starts out pretty slow, a couple of things drag, you don't know what's going on, at some points you're trying to figure out what genre the movie is and then things just really start to unravel and get better. The cracks start to form. Things begin to escalate and come together. The unusual soundtrack, along with its strange cinematography, makes you feel like you're on this ""high on life"" and trip on acid.Basically, the movie is a slow burn. It didn't leave me disappointed nor satisfied. It just will leave you in a state of ""Okay...what did I just watch??"" It's just one of those movies. Think Midsommar blended in with Scream. That's Holland. Not amazing, not bad, but weirdly interesting!"
"Considering the cast, this was very disappointingBad acting
Horrible soundtrack
Poor directing
Bad script
Horrible dream sequences that add nothing
Inconsistent pacing but leaning towards glacialAnd the voice of the lead actress was so annoying. Was this intentional or had she had some kind of problem. It really grated on my nervesThe film had sounded good but my wife and I were let down. A waste of time indeedThis is a film that would never get into my dvd collection, too boringThe setting of the film also made little sense and while some of the scenery was nice it added nothing to the filmAvoid this film."
"During the first hour everything was normal, but then the story picked up and I was hooked. Exceptional performance by Matthew Macfadyen especially. Love everything he does. An incredible actor.Nicole was fantastic. I throughly enjoyed the movie.Went in with low expectation, came out smiling.I really enjoyed not knowing where the story was taking me. Very light and comedic tones for most of the film and then it takes a sharp turn with horror elements. Needless to say, I had a fun time with this.One of those films where by the twist at the end, and thereby the conclusion, I said to myself, ""Is that really it?"""
"My Review- Holland
Streaming on Prime
My Rating 1/10I can't find one positive comment to say about this trashy melodramatic misfire of a movie.Is it a black comedy a suspense thriller or an attempt at some new blended genre ?I really it's just a bomb in every way that misfires.Nicole Kidman and Matthew McFadyen must have lost all sense of judgment to consent to star in this bizarre offering written by Andrew Sodroski and directed by Mimi Cave.It starts off like a bad saccharine Disney fantasy and ends like some weird very bad 1960's suspense thriller.Set in the cutest American town called Holland complete with tulips clogs we meet Nancy and Fred Vandengroot played by Nicole Kidman and Mathew McFadyen.The one point I gave Holland is for the fabulous model railroad that the son Harry Vandengroot has complete with a tulip farm and farms with windmills.Nancy is a teacher and homemaker with what seems like a picture perfect life with her husband Fred and son .Until she suspects Fred of infidelity and engages the help of Dave a fellow teacher to help find evidence to support her suspicions.From then on Holland sinks into a dyke and the plot just thickens like quicksand.Someone should remind Nicole Kidman who I have admired in many movies and series the old showbiz adage ""you're only as good as your last three movies"""
"Not sure why this film is getting so much hate. I live near Holland and they captured a lot of the vibe... tightly wound overly nice folks who don't say swear words. Without giving any spoilers, I enjoyed the cinematography and homage to 1950s films. The soundtrack also played into vibe. I thought the script was original and the acting was also great. While the accent was a bit more Minnesota than West Michigan, the actors are Australian, English, and Mexican, so I commend them. The surreal dream sequences were super quirky. I had a lot of fun watching it, and I really am not sure why so many people are giving it a bad review."
This is a true folk horror movie the acting and cast was by far the best the editing and filming was amazing and the dialogue was so good! If you like the movie midsommar this is definitely the movie for you it's filled with beautiful sets locations and extremely well done makeup effects. I loved how it was so happy then in the last second it hits you like a ton of bricks. I do understand folk horror is not for everyone but to the people who do like it you will enjoy this movie as much as I do it brought every element a good folk horror should have lots of costumes and historical aspects over all 7.5/10.
"First of all, let's talk about the elephant in the room: Nicole Kidman is too old for this role. She should play a grandma, not the wife. Her face not only is distracting, but sometimes it is scary. She reminds me of the Joker played by Jack Nicholson. Everybody gets old and wrinkly. Plastic surgeries, after a while, just make things worse.Now, the script. It is silly, juvenile and the ending.... Oh boy! The ending is beyond stupid. The whole movie is pretty much tedious. I really do not understand how these"" masterpieces"" get the green light to be produced. The end result is embarrassingly bad.After a while, I really did not care about what was happening, in fact I was dozing.I've should read something about Holland or a book about tulips. It would have been more rewarding."
"I was kind of excited to watch this movie, but after sitting through the whole thing I realized that my excitement was misplaced. Not the worst movie I have ever forced myself to sit through (only because I was hoping for a good reason to have just wasted my time), but not exactly good, either. The premise (I won't spoil it for those who are so inclined to waste some time) could have worked, but it just was not written well. The acting? Not anyone's best work for sure. Nicole Kidman's face was too distracting for all of the wrong reasons - plastic surgery, devoid of expression and emotion - and I could never figure out exactly how she was playing the character. I only saw an actor trying to do something, not the character in the story. Even the visuals were unimpressive and did not enhance the story - don't get me started about the microfiche scene or the trip through the ""train town."" Movie was a total disappoint for me."
"In 2000-based dramatic thriller ""Holland"" Nicole Kidman lives a life of apparent domestic bliss in her titular quaint Michigan town with optometrist hubbie Matthew Macfadyen & their young son Jude Hill... but prone to paranoia Kidman suspects Mcfadyen of having an affair, and 'persuades' colleague Gael Garcia Bernal to help her investigate - but is there anything to investigate, and if so, what? Mimi Cave (Nick's daughter) directs with a certain style (following up her awful ""Fresh"") but Andrew Sodroski's first solo screenplay takes 'slow-burn' to an all too sluggish level, and the climax ultimately isn't worth the time investment. It's passable entertainment, but only just."
"This movie is so disinteresting and does not follow the description Amazon provides at all. I cannot believe Nicole Kidman agreed to do this film. It is bad...sucky bad.Kidman plays a housewife and mom in this in a totally normal and mundane family. Everyone is plain, from looks to personality to the story itself. She finds a plain looking partner for an affair and from there she is trying to prove her husband is cheating. He knows nothing as she snoops around and follows him. She ends up discovering something she wasn't expecting. Classic story done a million times usually as a side plot but this is the plot.When I discovered the main plot of the movie, I quit watching. Maybe there was some twisty twist, I don't know. I was so bored out of my mind that I had to turn it off.If I paid for this, I'd say I want my money back, but I only paid my time and I wish I could get that back."
"The early part of film was spot on what Holland, MI is like. It is conservative,slightly Dutch accent in some folks. I lived nearby in MI for long time and attended the Tulip Festivals. She got it down. I suspect the Vandergroots are Dutch Reform Church attendees by some of the things they said. I like it that she didn't know what was going on with her husband, but something was off and unreal. Even to the end she questioned if everything she experienced really happened. The continuing darkness and irony that she wanted to start an affair while she accused her husband of having affairs. Then, Delgado was odd man out, being Hispanic, yet he was important to Nancy 's life."
"Nicole Kidman's back - relentless, polished, always just a little haunted. At this point, she's less of an actress and more of a presence. You don't stumble upon her work; it finds you. And when you add Matthew Macfadyen - yes, that Mr. Wamsgams - it starts to feel like a can't-miss setup. Two heavyweights, one glossy thriller, and the promise of a slow unravel.""Holland"" opens strong. A sense of dread humming beneath its surface, the kind of menace that hides behind manicured lawns and calm morning coffees. It echoes ""Nightbitch"" - Amy Adams's descent into the quiet madness of domestic life - the same themes of women simmering in boredom, choking on the sterile routines they've been sold.But then it slips.What could've been sharp and unsettling buckles under the weight of its own ambition. The twist - if you can call it that - lands with a thud. Not clever. Not earned. Just... tired. And what followed, in those last 10, maybe 15 minutes? A mess. The kind that doesn't just spoil the end - it undoes everything that came before.A wasted potential. And in a story like this, that's the real crime."
"Based on early reports from SXSW I didn't expect much from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised. Director Cave does a good job introducing us to what appears to be a relatively happy family living mundane lives, but deliberately peeling back the onion to reveal the horror within. The writing was not brilliant and the story was underdeveloped, with some characters and plot lines introduced only to be abandoned. Fortunately the three lead actors elevate the material; Kidman's desperation to escape a suffocating life but maintain her family's status; Macfadyen's determination to keep his family safe from a dark world he knows more intimately than he should, and Bernal's earnest concern to help a woman against his better judgment. My takeaway from this film is that for those who live relatively comfortably but are yearning for a more exciting life, be careful what you wish for!"
"I adore Nicole Kidman. Thought this movie had promised, since we love the upper peninsula/Holland, Michigan (we are Wisconsinites), and we really enjoyed the thick Michigan accents - - ESPECIALLY from the two leads, one of whom is Australian and the other British. And it was interesting how one can't really firmly pinpoint the ""time"" setting of this movie because between the landline phones/cellphones, decor, etc., it was either the 90s or the early 2000s (the 90s are out because people had the rudimentary antennaed cellphones instead of the early monolithic ones - but by the same token, Michiganders ARE known - - just like us Wisconsinites - - for using something until it just falls apart). However, although it was dark-campy fun for a while, they screwed the ending so badly that it destroyed the movie. I wouldn't bother."
"While the overall movie is nothing worthwhile, Nicole Kidman is a letdown. With all of her plastic surgery she keeps having the same facial expressions, which is next to nothing. I think because she's not capable of more facial expressions. She's become the same person and most of her roles. I was definitely a fan of hers and thought she's been great in many movies. But it just seems like now the plastic surgery was too much. So her roles are very plastic. Kind of a disappointment. The movie had some potential, but the flatness and her was the biggest letdown. If only Hollywood would not go overboard on all the facial augmentation or whatever you wanna call it these days."

If only Hollywood would not go overboard on all the facial augmentation or whatever you wanna call it these days."
"After 20 minutes I thought it was for kids, after 50 minutes I thought it was rubbish but because we were over halfway we decided to watch the rest of this wasteful movie, wasteful because it used very good actors, wasteful because this could have been made into a great thriller, wasteful because I will never get back that hour, forty nine minutes and fifty three seconds of my life. Would I recommend this movie to a friend? No, would I recommend this movie to an enemy? No, that's how much I think this movie is bad, very bad. So bad I am now simply drivelling on to make up the minimum character count. There you go, over 600."
"I had no expectations or foreknowledge about the movie, so came to it with an extremely open mind. As it progressed, I grew more and more bored and irritated. Was this yet another domestic drama about repression and infidelity with touches of comedy? Was this a Wes Andersonesque landscape but without the genuine human and heart. Was this a mystery thriller about a deranged killer? I'm all for blending genre but as the film went into the third act, it derailed into bizarre and gruesome territory which seemed more arbitrary than earned. I came away feeling mediocre script, directing that didn't create much pace and tension and consistent style, and, frankly, under utilized two good actors in Bernal and MacFayden. As for Kidman, well, as much as I credit her for the risks she took in ""Babygirl"" this role allowed her to utilize the same ole bag of tricks, the rather toxic hyper feminine repressed damaged housewife. Perhaps less a footnote in her career than a slight embarrassment. Overall, sad to say, kind of a waste all around."
"Pure entertainment! It's funny, it's suspenseful & comes with a surprising ending. Matthew Macfadyen & Gael Garcia Bernat are so good in this movie. It's the perfect movie for Amazon Prime. It's not going to win an Oscar, but, neither did Kindergarten Cop (and that's a great movie too). I loved it!Nicole Kidman is really great too, but overall, the two leading men are brilliant. The Michigan accents are perfect & you do get to see a lot of Tulips from the actual Tulip Festival that takes place in Holland, Michigan.It's definitely not ""child appropriate"", but it has a lot of funny/whacky parts."
"I had my hopes up for this movie for months because the reviews & Film Media raves seemed to be high before the movie was aired...my anticipation and excitement was diminished quickly. This is NOT a ""thriller "" at all in my experience. I was hoping for a modern style Hitchcock Hour, maybe even fuller with suspense.As Nicole Kidman is a fantastic actor, I was surprised she had decided to play in this film. Even at the mid-way point I am less interested which is disappointing. If this film had more substantial mystery this would make all the difference.I find the ""suspenseful intended"" moments to be incredibly dull.However, if you are seeking a ""Jurassic Park-type"" plot/theme/feel and music genre for a movie, this movie is for YOU!"
"I need to say that the acting was up to par. GreatCast of actors. Kidman, McFayden and BernalPlayed their roles beautifully and naturally. TheFirst half of the movie seemed good. A tad slowAnd not much going on. However, as the seconndHalf starts, then the movie begins to pick up thePace. I do not want to say much. Otherwise, I mayAccidentally say a few spoilers, but let's just sayThat the movie turns for the better. Not what IExpected. This is not a bad movie. It is not theBest movie, but it is still a good movie to watch.Give it a chance. The ending, though, I didn't get.I feel like they could have spent a few extraMinutes to give it a proper ending. All in all, aGood movie to watch."
"Well... this was certainly something. Unfortunately, the plot was a mess-way too weird and not believable, even considering that total realism isn't always the goal in a thriller. The story just didn't draw me in, and I found myself bored more often than not, which is a real shame for a genre that's supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat. Sadly, this movie wasn't worth my time.Even the attempts at atmosphere couldn't salvage the confusing narrative. A thriller should keep you on the edge of your seat, but this one had me checking the time more often than not.It's a shame because the premise had potential, and I was hoping for a gripping, suspenseful experience. Instead, it felt like a collection of odd ideas thrown together without a cohesive vision."
"Supposedly you know what's going to happen. I didn't. Many reviews say the lead is unreliable. The entire movie is strange, which sets the audience up for oddity after oddity and therefore it works. A family in a small town are boring and seemingly predictable. A well respected husband, father, deacon and optometrist has a secret life. The lead role, played by Nicole Kidman, knows instinctively as a wife that her husband is distracted. She investigates. What she finds out is horrific. It's fun to follow along as she tries to solve the mystery. Her love affair may not be real. But, the idea of a loving relationship gets her out of the stifling one she is in. And that's just fine by me. In the end she is free."
"This is the story of three crazy people. Although the major actors may appear normal at times, they are not. After all, most people play roles throughout their lives. Each actor exhibits a unique array of wacky behaviors and sometimes hallucinations. There is an attractive and suspicious wife who can manipulate a needy fellow teacher. Then there is an eye doctor who may or may not be a killer.If you know unbalanced adults, you may recognize behaviors that can fool the general public. Regular actions may be time-dependent or situationally dependent. Are insane people sensible? No, not always. A person searching for a coherent plot or a superficially simplistic story may be disappointed. Watch something else. There is also humor in this horror story.Would I recommend watching it?For many, no.For a few friends, yes. It is okay."
"The only scene they actually filmed in Holland was Windmill Island. Very bland overall. Combination of acting and dialogue make it impossible to connect with any of the characters. As mentioned in title, very disappointing overall and I admit, part of it come from a bias of growing up in a Dutch family in Holland, Mi. Maybe the story will connect better with audiences outside the region. Would also like to add and example, I believe in one scene it shows a character taking a commuter train from Holland to Greenville for a 3 day trip. Which A) is unnecessary do to the short distance B) Impossible do to the lack of a commuter train line to from Holland to Greenville."
"NO offence meant to any Dutch peopleor the fine folks of Holland, Michigan.The following commentary is strictly my impression of the movie. And that wasn't a very good impression. Nancy and Fred Vandergroot are two very white, cornbread white, nerdy goodie goodie two shoes people living a very vanilla white life in their very wallpapered house in a very white, apparently very tulipy community where the big excitement is making soda and milk or eating at the diner, or perhaps some bowling.Ok, I'll cut to the chase. Creepy people and creepy music......and not in a good horror movie type of way, ....and a plot and story that moves slower than molasses. And right at the very end it reveals it's big secret, but you've already guessed it and it is way less than anti-climatic. Nicole Kidman's character is about as bland as cornstarch and water, and just about as emotional as a biscuit. What was with her splattering ketchup all over her pretty apron? Was that supposed to be a hint at things to come? And the weird dreams? Just weird.And Fred...oh my, you betcha! Ok Nance. I couldn't hang with this boring white guy for a second....and I'm white! Oh wait, Hey Nance...I'm gonna go play with my train set, you betcha! Oh and Dave Delgado....""I'm sorry Nancy but if you want this brown meat you're going to have to commit...""What? Really? Silliness. And when Dave pops in on Fred doing his after work activity.....that was a fight and real life battle? Seriously? It looked like they were play acting....It's billed as a drama suspense thriller but the only suspense and drama for me was waiting around to see what this was all leading to, like pulling teeth. It was not thrilling at all, like the Vandergroots it was pretty boring.Don't waste your time...it's a dog. In fact I give it two woof's. WOOF WOOF!"
"School teacher Nancy Vandergroot (Nicole Kidman) and her optometrist husband Fred Vandergroot (Matthew Macfadyen) have a 13 year old son. They live in Holland, Michigan which is a theme-town based on Holland with tulips and windmills. She suspects her husband of cheating during his many trips and tells her only friend Dave Delgado (Gael García Bernal).The movie ends with the question, ""Was it even real?"" I constantly asked this while watching the film. It is not done well enough and that leave it feeling disjointed. It's kinda like Blue Velvet without the edge. These actors could do better and have done better. They need more cohesive material."
"I don't imagine that this movie will be getting any Oscar nominations. The acting was certainly less than stellar. In particular, Nicole Kidman's character was not terribly convincing. I was a bit amused to see that this was billed as a ""thriller"" because I never felt like it really pulled me in. The main theme of this flick seems to be that people in quaint small towns, in particular those in Holland Michigan, may seem like they are wonderful people who pretty much have it all together but, in actuality, it's all too good to be true. We are left to believe that Hollanders are likely a bunch of fakes with gruesome skeletons in their closets. Well, I grew up in NYC but have since lived in Ann Arbor, Detroit, Grand Rapids and for the last 22 years Holland Michigan. Of course the people here certainly aren't perfect, and like folks everywhere else we have our faults and disingenuous tendencies. However, overall I've chosen to live here in Holland precisely because these are truly the most caring and upstanding people I have ever met anywhere. I don't know what Ms. Kidman's issue is with Holland, but it seems to me that she has an ax to grind."
"I read the original Black List script for this film years ago. It was cool, and the concept was a unique one for sure. But the director just didn't pull it off this time. No offense to Mimi Cave, I'm sure this was just the wrong material for her, but I've *heard* that, even though she's not credited as a writer, she got in there and messed around the with the very script that made this potentially special. Of course it coulda been the producers meddling in places they shouldn't have...who knows, I wasn't there. But it definitely, like so many other films, at least brings up the point that directors should sometimes just let themselves be directors. You don't HAVE to be a writer/director, but I'm sure the problem is that it's an ego thing, and that directors proclaim that they can write, just because they're creative in other ways... But I hope more directors will follow Scorcese, Spielberg, etc etc and stick to what they're good at and let the writers handle the writing/story/characters."
"Who ever thought it was hood idea to make a film of this completely worthless screenplay.Who thought it was good idea to try and make a quirky off-beat mystery?And who thought it was a good idea to give this task to its director?Seldom have felt this upset over a film's complete lack of identity - it's indecisiveness is beyond anything I ever witnessed.Meant to be cute, it fails.Meant to be suspenseful, it fails even worse.Meant to have surprising twist, it bombs.This director has so little awareness of style, genre or direction it's unimaginable who decided or approved of this mess.And either Mrs Kidman has a serious drug problem that she has to pay for, which IO doubt, or she's just surrounded by crazy people who keep booking her for one lame gig after the other.It's such a shame to see such a great talent waste her time on something so poor."
"Prime Video's new offering is a strange thriller with comedic overtones that never quite decides which path to take to give us the most satisfaction. Mimi Cave evolves in its direction, which, despite all its drawbacks, allows the film to keep you coming back until the end.An indefinition that costs him dearly.It has interesting plots, especially at the beginning, but as we discover new things in the story, the film seems to get tangled up in the decisions it must make, and that's where we feel somewhat awkward as viewers about where to place our expectations or final feelings. While both aspects are amusing when executed, their combination doesn't quite fit the story being presented. Its comedic moments are well-achieved, while its thriller moments fail to deliver the final punch that would ultimately leave us feeling more satisfying. It had material to give us more depth, but we're left halfway between both experiences as viewers.A wasted cast.With a cast led by Nicole Kidman, Gael García Bernal, and Matthew Macfadyen, we're left with the feeling that they don't quite explode in their performances. While Kidman is powerful and the film's soul, her moments of doubt also affect her performance, ultimately preventing her from fully embracing her role. A similar situation exists with the two male cast members, who also feel limited, even though their performances are well-crafted.The mind game sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't.There are moments of success within all this vagueness in the film, and those successes occur when we enter the mind game of our protagonist, where at times her vagueness overwhelms us, leaving us at a crossroads as to how real everything we're seeing really is. This is aided in large part by the director's excellent direction, who evolves her staging and delivers small flashes of brilliance when it comes to creating a level of suspense and intrigue of certified quality. However, we also encounter a lack of daring when it comes to exploding in its final meters, and we're left with the feeling that the film is limiting itself to overflowing, as it seemed it would do throughout. A bittersweet journey that, in retrospect, ends up limiting a film with plenty of things it could have delivered.Conclusion.An interesting but unsatisfying venture that has moments of cleverness and others of confusion, but you feel like you didn't waste your time watching it because it manages to create certain connections thanks to the interesting nature of its three main characters. A platform film that you can watch over a weekend without high expectations. The film delivers; it won't be part of the year's big reviews, but it has its well-executed moments that validate it as a worthy and decent bet to see and enjoy, depending on your motivations."
"I don't know what was I expecting from a movie that came this year and I have no idea why did I see a movie the same day it came out on prime, but I'm pleasantly surprised. Nicole Kidman really stood out in this role (opposed to babygirl) even though there are similarities in characters. Regardless, the movie has good if not great cinematography, music!, acting, interesting story and screenplay, some things could've been done better but for a movie that was filmed in this year is pretty impressive. Did not expect that end, although it could've been much more creative and realistic if you ask me."
"Good concept, but somehow they found a way to act like they were beginners. How they took two actors that you would think could save questionable direction, they actually made it worse. I've been to Holland many times and it was featured in a way that made it seem hokey and cartoonish. I waited many years for this because of the Holland tie in, but now regret that I took the time to watch it.I've begun to question anything that Nicole Kidman is in. Her best was ""Dead Calm"" and sadly she never got better.Matthew MacFadyen was probably one of the best characters on Succession, but also fell short in this movie.Overall, I was very disappointed with how this movie turned out.It's ok to kill time, but it may also kill brain cells.Hallmark meets after school special is the best way to describe this."
"I tend to ignore IMDb scores when choosing what to stream. And I'm glad I ignored the pretty low score for this one because it turned out to be a stylish movie that was really worth a watch.I have no idea why it was set in the 90s when laptops weren't around and mobile phones looked nothing like they do today. I don't think they went to all that trouble just in order for the story to function, because the way I see it, it CAN function pretty much the same also today. So, there was either something deeply personal, or those behind the decision went for the aura of the 90s, which pays off visually.The acting was top notch. And the pacing wasn't bad either. I got pleasantly surprised as little turns and twists derailed what I imagined was going to be a small story of betrayal. The ultimate revelation caught me offguard as clues to it were not planted into the earlier parts of the script (great decision! I hate it when movies welcome their own spoilers!) but I think they failed to wrap the whole thing up in the best way possible.I'm down with a movie changing its genre midway. Heck, I even love it! But the kind and level of undecidedness with the ending did not satisfy me. ""Was it even real?"" Well, for that question to make sense, there had to be some more solid outcome.I don't think many people will love this movie. But I also don't think it would be fair to consider it a loss of time. Because it has that weird European feeling to it as Holland, Michigan provides a fresh breath to the very common American Beauty / Desperate Housewives / Revolutionary Road structure.I'm not saying this is better than those well-known examples of this sub-genre. But it delivers something different along the way, even despite the ambiguity with the end game."
"Nicole Kidman's plastic surgery and upper lip, joker smile did not fit the role of a humble Michigan wife. I think she was miss casted. Not really her fault. More of the director fault. The movie moved forward pretty slow similar to this review that requires so many characters. I am currently three hundred characters away from being finished. Well I can't of any more filler and I am still two hundred characters away from completing this horribly boring review. I hope you enjoy the movie it passed the time while I was eating dinner. Almost most write more, just a little more and I am out. Did not finish the movie."
"Really - when was the last time Nicole Kidman actually made a really good *movie*... at least 6 years ago with 'Bombshell' is pretty much the answer! That's a long time in Hollywood for an A-lister folks.While the undeniable Oscar-winning superstar always puts in a decent enough shift, her poor choice of movies over the past decade has definately tarnished her lofty reputation, to the point where i'm reluctant to even check her latest filmatic works out without reservation (tv shows excepted).Following hot on the heels of the awful 'Babydoll', Kidman stars in the MGM-Amazon (uh oh) collab 'Holland' - a so=called thriller that plays more like an unfunny dark comedy-drama.Indeed, there really is nothing going on here to write home about, which is no surprise seeing as the script has been kicking around studios since 2013! All the characters are lame, unlikeable and downright annoying. The screenplay is dull, boring and wholly predictable, while the low production values and poor direction have 'straight=to=stream' written all over them.All in all then another disappointing outting from Nicole, whichs firmly puts her alongside such other once stellar A-listers as Halle Berry, Angelina Jolie and Jessica Chastain as huge talents who need to stop making so many garbage films and get back to some real work!"
"Unfocused and uneven. What could have been a satire of stifling Midwestern suburbia, a twisty mystery or a cat-and-mouse thriller instead left me 'meh'. Hints that Nicole Kidman's and Gael Garcia Bernal's characters have had chequered pasts are left untapped (there's nothing to explain how they even develop such a bond). I kept waiting for it to fulfill the potential of its rather stellar cast, then it completely fell apart in the last act when some. Really unsatisfying, especially how one of the main characters disappears entirely. The only thing that stood out for me was the dream sequence.."
"Before my comment, I'd like to say that this flick is dear Kidman's Best performance. Matthew Macfadyen is our generation's few outstanding actors, Mr. Bernal is exceptional Spanish actor. Entire ensemble delivered their best.This is a gorgeously produced , visually stunning thriller..yep it is a thriller..perfectly twisted..Having seen most of Kidman, dare say..not particularly a fan of her early work, this one is a KeePer.We watched this film on air. From synopsis I thought this would be flick like Stepford Wives...see it is NOT...this flick will null you in the first half..yet will leave you soRRy once you keep it up."
"So weird, and boring with no true direction. The acting is ok but the story is odd. So contrived and expected. I did not recommend this movie at all especially if you're a fan of Nicole Kidman, she is great in so many shows but in this movie Everything Is lackluster. Some of the fake accents trying to imitate accents of people from Michigan are just so poorly done in this movie and the storyline for me was so unimaginative that I lost interest and then I couldn't follow it because I had no interest in it. There are some good actors in this movie but this movie is not going to do anything for their careers cuz for me this was a complete bust."
"I suppose , nice is the fair term to define this film . Correct, seductive - first for presence of Nicole Kidman , Jude Hill or Gael Garcia Bernal, for picturesque scenes and for fair crafted tension, interesting use of ambiguity , smart reflection of game of apparences ( in few scenes reminding, too much for my taste, The Perfect Wives ), it is pretty unfair to be very critic about it, being seduced by the performance of Nicole Kidman, by silent passion of Dave Delgado or by suppositions about husband behavior.But, against obvious good points, the feeling about supperficiality of story remains . Not exactly a sin but only proof about a beautiful film , new demonstration of Nicole Kidman skills for portrait of victim of appearences . And it seems enough."
"Watched this because of the cast (in particular, Matthew Macfadyen, who tends to be supremely brilliant in whatever he is in). Was tempted to abandon ship about an hour in due to epic sluggishness of the narrative, but stuck with it as I figured that, surely, there HAD to be some tasty twisty plot thing just around the corner. There was (eventually), but it was horribly unsatisfying, prosaic & clunky. Final denouement was meaningless drivel. Strange how these things get green-lit really and proves once again the story-telling adage that, when it comes to premise and script, you can't polish a turd."
"This was my favourite movie of 2025. Excellent in many ways with Nicole Kidman turning in an unforgettable performance. If you like mystery and thrillers then don't hesitate to watch the beauty.Sure, it's a little quirky kinda like Fargo but it's intentional and supposed to represent Holland, Detroit.Give them a a chance and you will be glad you did.Highly impressed and definitely recommend!Don't listen to the bad reviews. Seriously don't listen to the bad reviews as I'm not quite sure what the heck they were watching.Thanks for reading this review and enjoy the movie, it's excellent."
"From the director of Fresh comes a suburban nightmare that's powered by a manic performance from Nicole Kidman yet lacking in everything else. A twisted mystery thriller that takes too long to get going, is too slow to retain interest and also too hesitant to go all-in, Holland exhibits glimpses of potential in its execution but is more or less a mediocre entry that's salvaged by a fantastic turn from its leading lady.Directed by Mimi Cave, the story presents our protagonist living an idyllic life in the titular town which begins to crumble in the wake of a suspicion. Cave invokes this unnatural, uncanny vibe from the suburban setting but takes way too much time to get the wheels moving. Much of the narrative goes around in circles with characters that are thinly sketched and then fails to bring the journey to a satisfying close.What makes the ride interesting is Nicole Kidman who's brilliant throughout and showcases her acting range with comfort & confidence. Her rendition expertly juggles sharp wit with distrust & confusion, plus it's her assured performance only that keeps the story glued together and steer past the finish line. Gael García Bernal & Matthew Macfadyen also provide fine support but this is Kidman's show and she effortlessly delivers.Overall, Holland has a few elements working in its favour but the film as a whole still ends up being an underwhelming experience, if not a forgettable one. The tension & suspense is invoked without effort but it just as easily dissipates too. The finale had the opportunity to make the ride worthwhile but it instead concludes with a whimper. A weaker outing compared to the director's previous venture, Cave's sophomore feature is serviceable at best."
"Where was the mystery? It's billed as a mystery thriller,, but it just wasn't there. The movie was as boring as Holland is. There was too much whispering, too many unlit scenes, and absolutely no chemistry between any of the actors. Very slow moving and too much extraneous stuff going on without connecting it. Voice-overs were not advancing any of the storytelling. They said it took over a decade to get made, but the surprise is it got made at all. One of the worst films I've seen. To top it off, the accents were poorly done. It seems like they were mimicking Minnesota accents and not at all like Michigan."
"I had high hopes for Holland, especially with Nicole Kidman leading the cast, but I ended up feeling a bit underwhelmed. While her performance was solid, I expected more depth and nuance from an actress of her caliber. One thing I did enjoy was the 90s aesthetic, it gave the film a nostalgic, moody atmosphere that worked well for a psychological thriller. The twist was decent, but it didn't leave a lasting impact. The pacing felt off at times, making certain moments drag. Overall, it wasn't a bad movie, but it didn't fully deliver on its potential. It had moments of intrigue, but it fell short of being truly memorable."
